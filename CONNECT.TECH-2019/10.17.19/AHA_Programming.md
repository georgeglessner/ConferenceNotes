Live coding demo on how to minimize large and clunky abstractions. 

- Create functions for repeated code. Do not copy/paste in multiple places, this can lead to many bugs all over your codebase. 
	- Wait for commonalities in duplicate code to scream at you for abstraction. 

- In-line all abstractions when possible
	- Don't add a million features to an abstraction

- We can't tell what the future of our code is going to be, don't build an abstraction to try to account for something in the future.

- Be thoughtful of the abstractions you are making. 

- Duplicaiton is far cheaper than the wrong abstraciton, so prefer duplication over the wrong abrstraction.
