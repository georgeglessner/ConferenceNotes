# The Death of the Full Stack Developer (and what to do about it)
> Cory House

Full stack development is an onion that needs to be peeled to get through all the layers of the "need-to-knows". 

### Going Pro
- No degree required to be a developer. 
- Not about appearance, about focus. 

### Becoming "Famous"
- You don't need a monopoly. 
- Pays to specialize.

Example: Giordano's vs Costco pizza. Both have good pizza, Giordano's specializes in it however.

- Narrower = more expertise. 

- Specialization leads to increased salary on average. 

- Breadth of knowledge is over-rated. 

- I want to be exceptional at _________. 

- Stop asking how can I do it all, and start asking what do I want to go big on. 

- If you want to be an anomaly, you've got to act like one. 

- Specialization becomes a necessity as industries mature.
