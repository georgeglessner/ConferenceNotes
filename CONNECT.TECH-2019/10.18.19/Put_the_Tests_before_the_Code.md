# Put the Tests before the Code
> Mike Clement

The goal is to have clean code that works

## XP Simple Design
- passes all tests
- clear, expressive, consistent
- no duplication
- minimal

Testing -> Coding -> Design 

## Uncle Bob's 3 Laws of TDD
1. you may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
2. you may not write more of a failing test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing
3. you may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test

> Write a failing test -> make the test pass -> refactor -> write the next failing test

Key Takeaway: RED, GREEN, REFACTOR

## Rule or Perpetual Inconsequence
- At every stage you are writing code that seems inconsequential
